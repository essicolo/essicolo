### Hi üëã!

I code in Python, R, SQL and a little bit of Javascript, all for data science and arts. Most of my repositories are in fact supplementary materials to reproduce the results of my scientific papers.

I packaged two Python libraries, a small set of dummy methods making pandas more tidy-friendly in `seekwellpandas`, and DJalgo, a user-friendly (but challenging to code) package for music composition intended to be used in [Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) and [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) notebooks.

- [`djalgo`](https://gitlab.com/essicolo/djalgo), on Gitlab

 I also love creating educational contents: I set up some reposotories for lectures and courses.

- [In French] [**üê® Analyse et mod√©lisation d'agro√©cosyst√®mes avec R**](https://github.com/essicolo/ecologie-mathematique-R). I wrote this book as a support for a course I created. The book is kind of oudated, but there is a [fork](https://github.com/chavalli/ecologie-mathematique-R) from the people who took up the course. Why a koala emoji? Because there is no emoji for the opossum.
- [In French] [**Introduction au calcul num√©rique avec Python**](https://github.com/essicolo/introduction-au-calcul-numerique-avec-python). Here and there, I'm asked to teach Python to academic students and professionals. This is a very short take on how to start using Python for science and engineering. But I wrote it before the AI boom, so maybe it would need adjustments.
- [**DJalgo's User Guide**](https://djalgo-ef307e.gitlab.io/source/user-guide.html). This is a guide for composing music with math while staying in the browser. For long, I wondered how to soundify mathematics. I found some composers using intriguing techniques to do so, implemented some of my own, packaged it in DJalgo and wrote a free online book in the subject. I'm pretty proud of the outcome.

Oh, yeah, CV time. I'm a hydraulic engineer and interdisciplinary academic researcher in ecological engineering, agriculture, and data science. Also algorithmic musician.
