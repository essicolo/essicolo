### Hi!

I code in Python, R, SQL and Javascript, all for data science and arts. Most of my repositories are in fact supplementary materials to reproduce the results of my scientific papers.

I'm working on professionnal projects in hydrology, ecology and agriculture. Personal projects here on GitHub include 

- `nuee`, a multivariate data analysis package for numerical ecology,
- `jmon-studio`, a JavaScript library for music composition with code and math (no-AI). `jmon-sutio` is designed to be the successor of `djalgo`, which I coded for Python. 

I also love creating educational contents: I set up some reposotories for lectures and courses.

- [In French] [**üê® Analyse et mod√©lisation d'agro√©cosyst√®mes avec R**](https://github.com/essicolo/ecologie-mathematique-R). I wrote this book as a support for a course I created. The book is kind of oudated, but there is a [fork](https://github.com/chavalli/ecologie-mathematique-R) from the people who took up the course. Why a koala emoji? Because there is no emoji for the opossum.
- [In French] [**Introduction au calcul num√©rique avec Python**](https://github.com/essicolo/introduction-au-calcul-numerique-avec-python). Here and there, I'm asked to teach Python to academic students and professionals. This is a very short take on how to start using Python for science and engineering. But I wrote it before the AI boom, so maybe it would need adjustments.
- [**DJalgo's User Guide**](https://djalgo-ef307e.gitlab.io/source/user-guide.html). This is a guide for composing music with math while staying in the browser. For long, I wondered how to soundify mathematics. I found some composers using intriguing techniques to do so, implemented some of my own, packaged it in DJalgo and wrote a free online book in the subject. Techniques include loops, minimalism, randomized walks, fractals and genetic algorhitms. I also cover AI in music: though there are impressive AIs around, I'm encouraging and show how to create one of your own.

As for CV, I'm a hydraulic engineer and interdisciplinary academic researcher in ecological engineering, agriculture, and data science. I also can draw a gold fish.
